# structured-query-response-language
A structured language (like SQL, HTML, etc) for specifying valid queries and responses.

Basically, be both machine and human readable to a reasonable degree, like JSON or HTML5, and specify commands and queries that can be issued by any party, and who should respond with what at what time, along with a description on "why", and "priority" (just an ordered ranking).

For use in other projects that need some method of communicating, with out debugging because a JS stype comment was in a JSON file. This project is meant to be useful and simple.
